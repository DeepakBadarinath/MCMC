# MCMC
MCMC work done during research assistantship under Prof. Bou Rabee.



We run simulations to compute the total number of evaluations of the target density and the gradient of the target density required to reach $\delta$-close to a multivariate Gaussian target, for different Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The algorithms we consider are Metropolis random walk (MRW), unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA), unadjusted Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (uHMC), Metropolised Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (mHMC) and the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). 
We give theoretical results for the cost required to reach $\delta$-close to the target for ULA and uHMC and cite appropriate results for the other algorithms
